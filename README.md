# 🧪 Project CHAOS

**Codex of Hacks And Outrageous Schemes** — A digital lab notebook for developers who think like mad scientists.

---

Project CHAOS is a CLI tool built in Go that lets you create structured, timestamped markdown entries to log your daily experiments, debugging battles, spontaneous ideas, and war notes against your coding rival.

It’s built for hackers who don't want a polished UI — just raw, fast documentation that mirrors their thought process.
